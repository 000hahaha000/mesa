"""Compression support for backends.

This includes both compression and decompression support.

This provides a low level interface of dictionaries, COMPRESSORS and
DECOMPRESSORS, which use compression modes ('bz2', 'gz', 'xz', 'none') to
provide open-like functions with correct mode settings for writing or reading,
respectively.

They should always take unicode objects. It is up to the caller to ensure that
they're passing unicode and not bytes.

A helper, get_mode(), is provided to return the user selected mode (it will try
the PIGLIT_COMPRESSION environment variable, then the piglit.conf
[core]:compression key, and finally the value of compression.DEFAULT). This is
the best way to get a compressor.

# Test the "fast clear" functionality of i965/gen7+ when a redundant
# clear is done, but to a different clear color.
#
# Fast clear functionality on i965/gen7+ operates by deferring the
# memory writes that would normally be done during a buffer clear so
# that they happen either during rendering or at the time buffer data
# is read (e.g. by glReadPixels).  If two fast clears appear in a row,
# the second clear can be elided (even if it clears to a different
# color, since none of the color writes have occurred yet).
#
# This test verifies that if two fast clears are performed in a row,
# the color that takes effect is the color from the second clear.  As
# with fast-clear-all-colors.shader_test, we also make a draw call
# that touches a small number of pixels and outputs the same color.
# This is to ensure that some writes are deferred to rendering time
# and others are deferred until glReadPixels time, so that we verify
# that correct data is written in both circumstances.

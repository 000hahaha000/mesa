  <!-- This inverses the order of shader and compiled tests, this is
       intentional. For gpu (with isolation), shader tests are small and can be
       assumed to be very quick, while compiled tests will almost certainly be
       slower. Without isolation that is reversed, shader tests take much longer,
       so putting them first improves runtime.

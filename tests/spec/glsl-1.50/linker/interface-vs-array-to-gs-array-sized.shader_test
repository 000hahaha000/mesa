# From the GLSL 1.50 spec, section 4.3.7 (Interface Blocks):
#
#     Matched block names within an interface (as defined above) must
#     match in terms of having the same number of declarations with
#     the same sequence of types and the same sequence of member
#     names, as well as having the same member-wise layout
#     qualification (see next section). Furthermore, if a matching
#     block is declared as an array, then the array sizes must also
#     match (or follow array matching rules for the interface between
#     a vertex and a geometry shader).
#
# This test verifies that trying to link a VS output interface array
# to a sized GS input interface array fails, even if the size of the
# GS input interface array matches the size of the VS output interface
# array.

# From section 7.1 (Built-In Language Variables) of the GLSL 4.10
# spec:
#
#   The gl_PerVertex block can be redeclared in a shader to explicitly
#   indicate what subset of the fixed pipeline interface will be
#   used. This is necessary to establish the interface between multiple
#   programs.  For example:
#
#   out gl_PerVertex {
#       vec4 gl_Position;    // will use gl_Position
#       float gl_PointSize;  // will use gl_PointSize
#       vec4 t;              // error, only gl_PerVertex members allowed
#   };  // no other members of gl_PerVertex will be used
#
#   This establishes the output interface the shader will use with the
#   subsequent pipeline stage. It must be a subset of the built-in members
#   of gl_PerVertex.
#
# This appears to be a clarification to the behaviour established for
# gl_PerVertex by GLSL 1.50, therefore we test it using GLSL version
# 1.50.
#
# Note that this test is verifying functionality when gl_PerVertex is
# correctly redeclared, so it doesn't include the erroneous "vec4 t"
# declaration.
#
# This test verifies that the geometry shader can redeclare gl_PerVertex
# specifying a subset of the built-in values (gl_Position and
# gl_PointSize), and the subset works.
#
# This test draws a small point in the left half of the window and a
# large point in the right half.  Then it probes the region around
# each point to ensure that the point on the right is larger.
#
# NOTE: since gl_PointSize is expressed in pixels, but gl_Position is
# expressed relative to the window size, this test is dependent upon
# the window size.  It uses a window size of 250x250, which is the
# specified as the size requirement for the test.

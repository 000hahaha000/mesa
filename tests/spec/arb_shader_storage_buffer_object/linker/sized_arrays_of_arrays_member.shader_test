# From ARB_program_interface_query spec:
#
#    "For the property of BUFFER_DATA_SIZE, then the implementation-dependent
#    minimum total buffer object size, in basic machine units, required to
#    hold all active variables associated with an active uniform block, shader
#    storage block, or atomic counter buffer is written to <params>.  If the
#    final member of an active shader storage block is array with no declared
#    size, the minimum buffer size is computed assuming the array was declared
#    as an array with one element."

/** @file readpixels-oob.c
 *
 * Test that requesting an area larger than the readbuffer (with
 * glReadPixels) will only modify the valid area in the user's buffer.
 * This is equivalent to a user requesting to read into a sub-rectangle
 * of the larger rectangle contained in the provided buffer (via
 * PACK_ROW_LENGTH, PACK_SKIP_ROWS, PACK_SKIP_PIXELS).
 *
 * This behaviour ensures that Mesa does as little work as possible in
 * this imprecise usage of glReadpixels. It also reduces the bugs that
 * may occur with this special case by converting it to an analogous
 * common case.

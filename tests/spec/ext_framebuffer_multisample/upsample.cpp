/**
 * \file upsample.cpp
 *
 * Verify the accuracy of upsampling from a non-MSAA buffer to an MSAA
 * buffer.
 *
 * This test operates by drawing a test image in the window system
 * framebuffer (which is non-MSAA), and then blitting it to an MSAA
 * framebuffer, forcing the implementation to upsample it.
 *
 * To verify that upsampling has properly replicated each pixel value
 * in each of its samples, we blit from the MSAA buffer back to the
 * window system framebuffer.  This causes all of the samples for each
 * pixel to be blended, so if any of the pixels were not upsampled
 * correctly, we would expect the downsampled image to be different
 * from the original image.
 *
 * When testing depth and stencil buffers, we need to modify this
 * procedure slightly, since downsampling depth and stencil buffers
 * doesn't cause the pixels to be blended.  So, after the first blit,
 * we execute a "manifest pass" to translate the depth or stencil
 * image into a color image.  This is done independently in both the
 * MSAA and non-MSAA buffers.  Then we downsample the resulting color
 * image as before.
 *
 * Note: this test relies on proper functioning of the MSAA buffer and
 * the downsample blit.  These are already adequately tested by
 * accuracy.cpp.

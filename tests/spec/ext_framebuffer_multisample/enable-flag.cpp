/**
 * \file enable-flag.cpp
 *
 * This test verifies the proper functioning of the GL_MULTISAMPLE
 * flag.  From the GL 3.0 spec (p.116):
 *
 *     "Multisample rasterization is enabled or disabled by calling
 *     Enable or Disable with the symbolic constant MULTISAMPLE."
 *
 * Elsewhere in the spec, where multisample rasterization is described
 * (sections 3.4.3, 3.5.4, and 3.6.6), the following text is
 * consistently used:
 *
 *     "If MULTISAMPLE is enabled, and the value of SAMPLE_BUFFERS is
 *     one, then..."
 *
 * So, in other words, disabling GL_MULTISAMPLE should prevent
 * multisample rasterization from occurring, even if the draw
 * framebuffer is multisampled.
 *
 *
 * This test operates by performing the following operations:
 *
 * 1. Verify that the default state of GL_MULTISAMPLE is enabled.
 *
 * 2. Draw a test image into a multisampled buffer, with
 *    GL_MULTISAMPLE disabled.
 *
 * 3. Blit this image to the left half of the piglit window (which is
 *    not multisampled) to resolve it.
 *
 * 4. Draw the same test image into a single-sampled buffer.
 *
 * 5. Blit this image to the right half of the piglit window.
 *
 * 6. Verify that the two halves of the piglit window match.  If they
 *    don't, then presumably the disabling of GL_MULTISAMPLE failed to
 *    take effect.

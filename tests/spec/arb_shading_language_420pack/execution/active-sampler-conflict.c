/**
 * \file active-sampler-conflict.c
 *
 * Verify results of program validation when a conflicting sampler
 * configuration is used via the binding layout qualifier.
 *
 * Section 11.1.3.11 (Validation) of the OpenGL 4.5 spec says:
 *
 *     "An INVALID_OPERATION error is generated by any command that trans-
 *     fers vertices to the GL or launches compute work if the current set of
 *     active program objects cannot be executed, for reasons including:
 *
 *         - any two active samplers in the current program object are
 *           of different types, but refer to the same texture image
 *           unit,"
 *
 * Here we test the INVALID_OPERATION by both calling glValidateProgram
 * and glDrawArrays.

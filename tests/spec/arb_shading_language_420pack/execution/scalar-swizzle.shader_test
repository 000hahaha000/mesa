/* The ARB_shading_language_420pack says:
 *
 *     "The component names x, r, and s are, for example, synonyms for the same
 *      (first) component in a vector.  They are also the names of the only
 *      component in a scalar.
 *
 *      Add to the example
 *
 *          float height;
 *          height.x // is legal
 *          height.y // is illegal"
 *
 * Verify that swizzles on scalars work.

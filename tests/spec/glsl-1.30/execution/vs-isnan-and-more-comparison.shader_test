# Test proper behavior of the isnan(vec2) function.
#
# Note: testing behavior if isnan() is challenging because the GLSL
# 1.30 spec does not explicitly define any circumstances under which
# NaN values are required to be generated.  This test assumes that the
# expression 0.0/0.0 produces a NaN value when evaluated in the
# shader.

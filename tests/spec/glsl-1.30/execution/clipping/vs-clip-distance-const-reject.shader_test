# From the GL 3.0 spec, section 2.17 (Clipping):
#
#   A vertex shader may, instead of writing to gl ClipVertex, write a
#   single clip distance for each supported clip plane to elements of
#   the gl ClipDistance[] array. The half-space corresponding to clip
#   plane n is then given by the set of points satisfying the
#   inequality
#
#     c_n(P) >= 0
#
#   where c_n(P) is the value of clip distance n at point P.
#
# This test checks that gl_ClipDistance works properly for the trivial
# case where gl_ClipDistance[0] is a constant value less than zero.

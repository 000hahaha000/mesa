# From the GLSL 1.30 spec:
#
#     Selects which vector each returned component comes
#     from. For a component of a that is false, the
#     corresponding component of x is returned. For a
#     component of a that is true, the corresponding
#     component of y is returned. Components of x and y that
#     are not selected are allowed to be invalid floating point
#     values and will have no effect on the results.

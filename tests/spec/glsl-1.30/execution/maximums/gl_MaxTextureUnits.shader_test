# [description]
# Tests for GLSL 1.30 minimum maximums for the builtin constants.
#
# See the GLSL 1.30.08 specification, section 7.4, page 67.
#
# Note that the limit should have been 2, but it is incorrectly listed as 16.
# This was fixed in GLSL 1.50 (see page 75 (page 81 of the PDF)), but the fix
# was never back ported to 1.30 or 1.40.

[require]
GLSL >= 1.30

[vertex shader]
#version 130
void main(void)
{
	gl_Position = gl_Vertex;
}

[fragment shader]
#version 130

	if (gl_MaxTextureUnits >= 2)
		gl_FragColor = vec4(0, 1, 0, 0);
	else
		gl_FragColor = vec4(1, 0, 0, 0);
}

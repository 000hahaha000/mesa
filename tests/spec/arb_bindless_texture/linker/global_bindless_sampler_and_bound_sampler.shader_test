# The ARB_bindless_texture spec says:
#
#  "If both bindless_sampler and bound_sampler, or bindless_image and
#   bound_image, are declared at global scope in any compilation unit, a link-
#   time error will be generated. In the absence of these qualifiers, sampler
#   and image uniforms are considered "bound".  Additionally, if
#   GL_ARB_bindless_texture is not enabled, these uniforms are considered
#   "bound"."

# Tests linking a shader with a large workgroup and local data set.
#
# This is related to:
# Bugzilla: https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=93840
#
# There are two important elements to this test:
#
# 1. local workgroup size of 1024 based on the spec requirements.
#
# 2. Use a 'large' size of live local data. In the test this is
#    controlled with the SIZE macro. This is hardware specific, and
#    the value of 64 was chosen because it was observed to fail on the
#    Mesa i965 driver.

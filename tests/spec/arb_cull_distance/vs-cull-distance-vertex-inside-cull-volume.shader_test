# Use one gl_CullDistance values to _not_ "cull" away a vertex with a positive
# value supplied to gl_CullDistance.
#
# The gl_CullDistance variable provides a mechanism for controlling user
# culling. The element gl_CullDistance[i] specifies a cull distance for each
# plane i. A distance of 0.0 means that the vertex is on the plane, a positive
# distance means that the vertex is insider the cull volume, and a negative
# distance means that the point is outside the cull volume. Primitives whose
# vertices all have a negative clip distance for plane i will be discarded.

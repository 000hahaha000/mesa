"""A minimal profile that aims to touch test most major OpenGL features with as
few tests as possible.

This is largely aimed at bring up of a new driver or a driver on new hardware,
where performance and stability are not necessarily the best. The idea is to
touch the main functionality of important features without running for too
long. This *will* miss many corner cases, that's okay. For more stable
hardware or software stacks the "gpu" or "quick" profiles are probably more
appropriate.

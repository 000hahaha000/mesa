/**
 * \file parser_utils.h
 *
 * These are a bunch of plain-text parsing utilities, most of them
 * have the form:
 *   boolean-like parse_foo(input-string, output-foo, output-string)
 *
 * If the input is a well-formed string representation of a "foo"
 * value, as many characters will be read from the string as they are
 * needed to initialize the "foo" object returned via the first output
 * argument, and the boolean return value will evaluate to true.  If
 * the output string argument is not NULL, a pointer one past the last
 * character consumed to parse a "foo" value will be returned to the
 * caller so that the rest of the document can be processed (e.g. by
 * passing the output string as input string of another parse
 * function).
 *
 * If the input cannot be parsed as a "foo" object, the boolean return
 * value will evaluate to false and the input string will be returned
 * as output string as-is (which mimicks the behavior of the C
 * standard library strto* functions).  The "foo" output argument will
 * be left in an undefined state in that case.

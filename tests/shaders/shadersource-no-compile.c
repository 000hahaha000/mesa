/**
 * \file shadersource-no-compile.c
 * OpenGL 4.5 Core Profile section 7.1, in the documentation for CompileShader,
 * says: "Changing the source code of a shader object with ShaderSource does not
 * change its compile status or the compiled shader code."
 *
 * This test creates a shader, compiles it, changes its source, and links it.
 * The spec requires rendering done with this shader to be consistent with the
 * old source, not the new source, since the shader isn't compiled again after
 * the source is changed.
 *
 * According to Karol Herbst, the game "Divinity: Original Sin - Enhanced
 * Edition" depends on this odd quirk of the spec. See:
 * https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/mesa-dev/2016-March/109789.html

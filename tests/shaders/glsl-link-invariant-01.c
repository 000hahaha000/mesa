 * Negative test for inconsistent invariant qualifier usage between vertex 
 * shaders.
 *
 * Both vertex shaders involved in this test have a varying float variable
 * with the same name. But the first shader declares it with the invariant
 * qualifier while the second not. 
 * The test verifies that linking the 2 shaders together results in an error, 
 * according to GLSL 1.20 section 4.3.6:
 * The type and presence of the invariant qualifiers of varying variables with
 * the same name declared in linked vertex and fragments shaders must match,
 * otherwise the link command will fail.

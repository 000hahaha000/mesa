# XXX: This fails on CI since adding a new field in
# 20b2b70da884df33eb970c5fc7714362a829bb84 but passes locally; failure depends
# where in the struct the stack_size field is added. It's not clear what kind
# of undefined behaviour is at play, but I don't want that commit to be blocked
# since it fixes actual bugs.

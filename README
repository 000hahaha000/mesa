glcpp -- GLSL "C" preprocessor

This is a simple preprocessor designed to provide the preprocessing
needs of the GLSL language. The requirements for this preprocessor are
specified in the GLSL 1.30 specification availble from:

http://www.opengl.org/registry/doc/GLSLangSpec.Full.1.30.08.pdf

This specification is not precise on some semantics, (for example,
#define and #if), defining these merely "as is standard for C++
preprocessors". To fill in these details, I've been using the C99
standard (for which I had a convenient copy) as available from:

/**
 * Instantiate a program analysis class \p L which can calculate an object of
 * type \p T as result.  \p C is a closure that encapsulates whatever
 * information is required as argument to run the analysis pass.  The purpose
 * of this class is to make sure that:
 *
 *  - The analysis pass is executed lazily whenever it's needed and multiple
 *    executions are optimized out as long as the cached result remains marked
 *    up-to-date.
 *
 *  - There is no way to access the cached analysis result without first
 *    calling L::require(), which makes sure that the analysis pass is rerun
 *    if necessary.
 *
 *  - The cached result doesn't become inconsistent with the program for as
 *    long as it remains marked up-to-date. (This is only enforced in debug
 *    builds for performance reasons)
 *
 * The requirements on \p T are the following:
 *
 *  - Constructible with a single argument, as in 'x = T(c)' for \p c of type
 *    \p C.
 *
 *  - 'x.dependency_class()' on const \p x returns a bitset of
 *    brw::analysis_dependency_class specifying the set of IR objects that are
 *    required to remain invariant for the cached analysis result to be
 *    considered valid.
 *
 *  - 'x.validate(c)' on const \p x returns a boolean result specifying
 *    whether the analysis result \p x is consistent with the input IR.  This
 *    is currently only used for validation in debug builds.

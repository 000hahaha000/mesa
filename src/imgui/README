    ImFont: Minor adjustment to the structure.
    Examples: Removed unused variable.

Embedding the library into one's project is main way people seems to
work with ImGui. Since this is just for a debugging tool, we're not
exposing ourselves too much.

Apart from tweaking the GLEW include path, there is no other
modification to the files in this directory.

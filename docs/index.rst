Piglit
======
Piglit is an open-source test suite for OpenGL implementations.

Building piglit
---------------

Piglit is primarily distributed through git.  Given that driver
developers frequently need to rebuild tests for debugging purposes
during testing, we have found little value in publishing releases.

To check out piglit, use::

  git clone https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/piglit

To build piglit, see the `README`_.

.. _README: https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/piglit/blob/master/README.md

License
-------

Most piglit test cases are distributed under the MIT license, though
some code is under the GPL. The MIT license is the preferred license
for the project.

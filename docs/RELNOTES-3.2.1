                             PLEASE READ!!!!


Mesa 3.2.1 adds a number of bug fixes since the Mesa 3.2 release.
See the VERSIONS file for the exact list.


The GLU tessellator has been reverted back to the version included
with Mesa 3.0 since it's more stable.  The Mesa 3.1/3.2 tessellator
implemented the GLU 1.3 specification but suffered from a number of
bugs.

Mesa's implements GLU 1.1.

Ideally, people should use the GLU 1.3 library included in SGI's
OpenGL Sample Implementation (SI) available from 
http://oss.sgi.com/projects/ogl-sample/
People are working to make easy-to-install Linux RPMs of the
GLU library.
